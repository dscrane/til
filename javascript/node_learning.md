Going through the node.dev/learn 
  learning about the history of node and how it is implimented as well as the differences bewteen browser JS and NodeJS

  It went on to talk about the V8 engine along with the other populart engines out there
    it also talks about how JS has transitioned into being a more just-in-time compelation language rather than an interpolated language in many ways

  Then it moved on to the powers of node from the command line and how variables, passing arguments and accepting inputs works from the command line
    This section also went over the uses of the node command and the REPL in detail which gave me a new appriciation for the REPL

  The introduction to npm and all of the uses for some of the more popular libraries was also helpful although a little less so becuase I have seen a lot of them before

  The last several sections where all about the notable and most often used modules which was very very helpful because there were somethings that I had no realized node was capable of before going through the sections on the fs, os and event modules
