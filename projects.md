4/24-4/26 [
  worked on remaking an old copy of a website I created when I first started 
    - removed the boostrap styling from the original and added my own flexbox layout
    - redesign the artwork image layout and changed a few aspects of the modal to not take up the whole screen when opened
      - chrome seems to have some issues with how the images are sized within the modal but things seem to be working better on firefox at the moment
    - redesigned the contact form and added a php file to display the results of the submitted form to show that everything worked and the data was handled
    - reworked the layout to have a better chance of working on mobile. There are still some issues to work out for sure but it is much better than it was before
    - added sematic html5 tags for better document outlining 
    - deployed the updated site to heroku

    - added them to the full site I worked on and to the basic resume
  messed around in the shell trying to make a script to shuffle all the music I have
