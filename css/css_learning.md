    working on getting a decent display on mobile devices

  learning about BEM (block, element, modifier)
  a way of organizing projects into easily identifiable 
    blocks: that are unique and can be understood outside of their situation
    elements: which are part of blocks but need their parent block to be understood
    modifiers: ways of identify the state of a block or an element or different display values
  the way of defining the blocks, elements and modifiers is still very confusing at the moment. Need some more specific explanations and examples to understand the way they work together and flow as one
